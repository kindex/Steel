Added FluidEmitter.Fluid
Changed FluidEmitter.NumberOfParticleEmitted to Fluid.NumberOfParticlesEmitted

ActorDescription implements IsValid, previously only BaseActorDescription.IsValid was being called
Renamed DefaultUserOutputStream to ConsoleOutputStream
Removed IStreamReader and IStreamWriter. Instead you only need to use System.IO.Stream implemented classes, usually these will be MemoryStream, FileStream or BinaryStream

[0.8.9.0 - 2008-05-03]
Few minor changes to controller enums
Changed BaseController::Move; removed the CollisionGroup enum, it now takes an unsigned int. Also the other Move function now passes in 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e. 11111111111111111111111111111111 base 2) so all group are active.
Fixed up controller hit
Fixed access modifiers on CCDSkeleton
Fixed up Capsule Shape Description; removed unused pointer and set correct access modifiers
Added ConvexForceFieldShapeDescription and ConvexForceFieldShape
Abstracted the pointers in the force field shape descriptors. Removed the empty specific finalizers
Minor performance improvements for searching for managed instances
Removed finalizers and deconstructors from force field shapes
Added UserWheelContactModify and associated properties to WheelShapeDescription and WheelShape
Removed finalizers and deconstructors from all the shapes and shape descriptions; they were empty functions or setting managed variables to null which is not required. Inherited deconstructor and finalizer still exist.
Removed local copy of spring description from distance joint, this fixes up the spring not being there when DistanceJoint.SaveToDescription was called
Added Name property to BaseJointDescription
Changed access modifiers on BaseJoint, constructor is now protected
Fixed a bug where new joint where not being added to the joint collection of the scene
Fixed bug where assigning a material then upon GC collection of the material would cause a crash (thanks to nca2003)
Added CCDSkeleton to BaseShapeDescription
Fixed up CCDSkeleton Finalizer not releasing the unmanaged CCDSkeleton
Fixed up BaseShape::SaveToDescription not saving all managed variables, removed LoadFromDescription from BaseShape which was not needed and fixed up the access modifiers for BaseShape
Optimized RaycastHit RaycastHit::FromUnmanaged, now uses dictionary to search for managed shape
Removed Scene.GetMaterial(), use scene.Materials[ index ] instead
Adding shapes to an actor (using Actor.AddShape) now correctly adds them to the shape collection in the scene
SimpleTriangleMesh creates VerticesStream and TriangleStream when using the constructor SimpleTriangleMesh( NxSimpleTriangleMesh* simpleTriangleMesh );. This constructor is now protected. This also fixes calling TriangleMesh.SaveToDescription having null VerticesStream and TriangleStream in the returned descriptor
hanged Cloth::Create to Cloth::FromUnmanagedPointer to match coding style
Cloth::SaveToDescription now saves MeshData and ClothMesh properties, and doesn't require a core to be passed in
Removed _groupsMask from Cloth
Added Triangle default indexer, rewrote Triangle::Normal, added Triangle::Center(), added Triangle::Inflate and changed the To/From-Unmanaged to cast operators
Removed _spring from MaterialDescription, fixed access modifiers
Assigned unmanaged enum values to RemoteDebuggerObjectType values

Fixed Cloth returning a Ray ref instead of a Ray value
The binary is now signed
Added Scene.OverlappedShapes +12 overloads
Added Scene.CullShapes +2 overloads
Fixed up RaycastClosestShape and RaycastClosestBounds, RaycastHit is now a ref class, fixed small bug in RaycastHit when using ToUnmanaged
Added UserActorPairFiltering and associated

Fixed up WheelShape finalizer
Changed TireFunctionDescription to ValueType
Fixed and Changed Simple Triangle Mesh;
	Removed the Write/Read Vertices/Indices functions and replaced it with PhysicsStream. With this users can now interleave data and it conforms much better to the actual SDK. Physics Stream provides conveniance functions to replace the Write/Read Vertices/Indices functions.
	Its now releases the allocated vertices and indices where as it didnot before.
	Vertex Count and Index Count must now be set
Cooking now uses the cooking parameters supplied in the non blank constructor
RayCast is now Raycast
BaseRaycastReport is now UserRaycastReport
Changed UserContactReport::OnContactNotify's second param to ContactPairFlag
Removed onNameChanged events from classes. This was originally used for serialalization perposes, but there are easier and cleaner ways of handling this.
Fixed crash when assigning null to properties that use the UnmanagedPointer property of the value being set
